Additionally, I personally needed an out-of-the-box download manager, which led to the creation of this app.\nNext, I will introduce how to use this application.\nGet started\rConfigurations\rPro feature\rUpdate log\rDownload link"},"title":"Download Manager"},"/docs/download-manager/configurations/":{"data":{"":"","browser#Browser":"Settings Overview in Download Manager\nGeneral\rTheme\rThe app supports Light, Dark, and Auto themes.\nEnable Notifications\rThe app will send system Toast notifications when a download is completed.\nChange Language\rThe app supports around 20 built-in languages. If the change does not take effect, it may indicate that the corresponding language pack is not installed on your system.\nDownloads\rDownload UA (User-Agent)\rYou can modify the User-Agent in cases where certain platforms impose restrictions.\nChange Download Directory\rYou can change the default download location; previously downloaded files will not be affected.\nMulti-threading\rSupports up to 5 simultaneous threads per file, accelerating download speeds.\nBatch Download\rIf multiple online files need to be downloaded in bulk and their file extensions follow a certain pattern, you can use the batch wildcard feature to download them all at once.\nBrowser\rFile Type Detection\rThe built-in browser supports detecting various file types. If there are more specific file types, you can manually add them, typically separated by a space, such as mp2 m4a.\nBrowser Engine\rThe app offers Webview1 and Webview2 as engines for detecting download links within the built-in browser.

Application Principle":"If you want to learn more about the Download Manager, please take your time to go through the following documentation.\n1. How to start downloading\rMethod 1: In the ‚ÄúDownloads‚Äù tab, click the + button at the bottom right or top right corner to directly open a popup where you can input the download link. Simply enter the hyperlink you want to download.\nMethod 2: If you prefer to have a popup appear when clicking on downloadable files while browsing, it is recommended to use the in-app browser.\nMethod 3: Extensions, currently under development.\n2. In-app Browser\rThe Download Manager includes a built-in browser designed for sniffing out downloadable files from complex pages. This prevents scenarios where the default download link might lead to misleading executable files. For detailed usage instructions, see the ‚ÄúIn-app Browser‚Äù section.\nP.S. Don‚Äôt worry, this is not a Chromium wrapper; it uses Windows‚Äô built-in Edge WebView 2, so it won‚Äôt take up additional app space.\nP.S.2 Please be aware of the safety of the download platform. DMK itself does not check whether the downloaded file contains threats. Although the system‚Äôs default antivirus software will scan the file after the download is complete, it may mistakenly associate the downloader with the file.\n3. File Manager\rThe app includes a built-in file manager for managing downloaded files, supporting common file management functions such as opening, copying, moving, and renaming. However, it can only manage files within the download folder. Due to UWP sandboxing, files outside the download folder cannot be accessed or managed by the app.\n4. Application Principle\rAdvantages: The app uses the .Net Native Download Operation, which means the Download Manager uses truly native download threads, resulting in an extremely lightweight and fast experience."},"title":"Get started"},"/docs/download-manager/updatelog/":{"data":{"":"","v1546#v1.5.46":"v1.5.48\rDateÔºö2024/01/03\nImprovement: UI adjustment in settings v1.5.47\rDateÔºö2024/09/30\nBug fixes: Fix videos download v1.5.46\rDateÔºö2024/09/06\nFeature: Add menu option Feature: Add more info documentation Bug fixes: fix some circumstances while timer not take effect ","v1547#v1.5.47":"","v1548#v1.5.48":""},"title":"Update log"},"/docs/iptv/":{"data":{"":"","introduction#Introduction":"","qa-trouble-shoot#Q\u0026amp;A Trouble shoot":"Introduction\rIPTV Fluent is a powerful software solution designed for seamless IPTV streaming and management.\nThis section covers tutorial how to use IPTV Fluent.\nGet-Started\rConfigurations\rWhat's in IPTV Plus\rUpdate log\rHow to use?\rSimply type any m3u links you found online into [Search channels m3u/8 link] on the left and press Enter.
